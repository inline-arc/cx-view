# Dependency 
[Xlib/X11](x.org) - Xlib (also known as libX11) is an X Window System protocol client library written in the C programming language. It contains functions for interacting with an X server. These functions allow programmers to write programs without knowing the details of the protocol.

[Cairo](cairographics.org) - Cairo is implemented as a library written in the C programming language, but bindings are available for several different programming languages.Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices. Currently supported output targets include the X Window System (via both Xlib and XCB), Quartz, Win32, image buffers, PostScript, PDF, and SVG file output. Experimental backends include OpenGL, BeOS, OS/2, and DirectFB.
Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available (eg. through the X Render Extension).

# GOAL 
 simple image viwer in c which is quite simple and minimalistic run on any device with x server and low memory usage created with only as god ass c only ,
